### NAVIGATION BAR
A navigation bar (also called a Navbar) is a user interface element within a webpage that contains links to other sections of the website. In most cases, the navigation bar is part of the main website template, which means it is displayed on most, if not all, of the pages within the website.

### CTA
A call to action (CTA) is a prompt on a website that tells the user to take some specified action. A call to action is typically written as a command or action phrase, such as 'Sign Up' or 'Buy Now' and generally takes the form of a button or hyperlink.

### HERO SECTION
A hero section is a full screen section typically consisting of a background image, or video, or illustrations, or animations, with text and sometimes a call to action. There are other elements you will find on a hero section, but for most that is the gist. Basic imagery or media and text.

### 404 PAGE
A 404 page is a landing page that tells your site viewers the requested page is unavailable or, in some cases, doesn't exist. A 404 error tells users the page cannot be accessed â€“ and it can be a major problem. When users can't access a page, they can't find the information they need.
